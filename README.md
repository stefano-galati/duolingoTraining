This is a simple React app (bootstrapped with Vite) that helps me review the words I learn on the Duolingo app.

The "From Italian"/"From German" button flips all the cards to display their respective Italian or German side.
The "New" button generates the number of cards specified in the input above. It is IMPORTANT to note that once N cards are dealt, they will not appear in subsequent deals.
The "Restart" button allows all the cards to be reshuffled and dealt again.
The bottom right panel allows you to select a specific set of words from the full list.

"#Sets" lets you choose how many different sets to create.
"Chosen" allows you to select a particular set.
For example, if #Sets = 10 and Chosen = 2, the app will divide the entire word list into 10 equally populated sets and only consider the 2nd set.

If the values entered in the number inputs are incorrect, the "New" button will automatically correct them instead of applying the desired restriction to the choice of dealable cards.

Deployed on Netlify :)
